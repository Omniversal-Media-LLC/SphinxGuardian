# Voyagers II – Secrets of Amenti

The second volume of the *Voyagers* series delves into the “Secrets of
Amenti,” recounting historical and future‑looking transmissions from the
Guardian Alliance about the Halls of Amenti, ancient seeding events and the
process of planetary ascension.  Compiled by **Ashayana Deane**, this
expanded second edition interweaves cosmology, metaphysics and
contemporary “update” briefs covering events up to the early 2000s.

## Table of contents

Key sections of the book include:

- **Preface and Required Reading** – orient the reader and provide
  recommended prerequisites for understanding the Guardian material【126639197193535†L86-L96】.

  Transmission of 1998, detailing the origins and fall of Guardian
  lineages, the Amenti Rescue Mission and descriptions of the Halls of

  experiment on Earth, including the role of Sirius B, Melchizedek
  races, the science of ascension and the “Thousand–Years War”【126639197193535†L118-L133】.
- **Chapter 3: The Third Seeding** – details subsequent seeding
  events, the Arc of the Covenant, Lemuria’s destruction, migrations
  from Giza to Atlantis and the 2017 AD appointment for Amenti
  activation【126639197193535†L134-L149】.
- **Chapter 4: A Journey toward Awakening** – covers the sinking of
  Atlantis, Earth quarantine, the interplay of dreaming, ego and higher
  self and the significance of Alcyone and the Templar Seal【126639197193535†L150-L161】.
- **Chapter 5: Return to Amenti** – chronicles the
  re‑establishment of the Amenti halls, the influence of Pharaoh
  Akhenaton, the appearance of three Christic avatars and preparations
  for ascension【126639197193535†L162-L169】.
- **Chapter 6: Ascension Mechanics** – explains the mechanics of
  ascension, humanity’s evolutionary path, Earth time cycles,
  holographic beam technologies and DNA activation through the Halls of
  Amenti【126639197193535†L171-L183】.
- **Chapter 7: Countdown to Amenti** – examines recent history
  including Merkaba fields, the Philadelphia Experiment, solar crises,
  the Montauk Project and other events impacting ascension timelines【126639197193535†L184-L203】.
- **Chapter 8: Current Events** – introduces the Bridge Zone project,
  Bridge Zone mechanics, time‑cycle mechanics and DNA templating as
  part of the global ascension schedule【126639197193535†L203-L218】.
- **Chapter 9: Time Shift** – discusses ascending and descending
  planets, three tracks of time and the conditions required to open
  the Halls of Amenti【126639197193535†L224-L233】.
- **Chapters 10–14** – outline the opening of the Halls of Amenti,
  ascension schedules, Guardian Alliance emergency releases and updates
  on Anunnaki treaties, solar star‑gate interventions, the Montauk
  Project, Merkaba reversals and the genetic heritage of the Angelic
  Human and Rainbow Roundtables【126639197193535†L238-L320】.

## Key concepts

- **Halls of Amenti** – ancient crystalline chambers within Earth’s
  planetary core that function as way‑stations for souls entering and
  exiting the planetary morphogenetic field.  They are central to
  Guardian teachings on ascension and time‑cycle management【126639197193535†L96-L109】.
- **Seeding experiments** – the first, second and third seeding events
  represent successive attempts by Guardian races to cultivate
  human–angelic lineages on Earth.  Each seeding introduced specific
  genetic templates and governance structures and was challenged by
  competing factions【126639197193535†L118-L149】.
- **Electric Wars and Thousand–Years War** – cosmic conflicts among
  advanced races that led to the fragmentation of human races, the
  destruction of Lemuria and Atlantis and the establishment of
  quarantine fields【126639197193535†L111-L133】.
- **Ascension mechanics** – metaphysical physics describing how
  consciousness and DNA harmonics allow beings to move between
  dimensional bands.  Topics include Merkaba fields, holographic
  beams, DNA strand activation and the integration of higher
  identity stations【126639197193535†L171-L183】.
- **Bridge Zone Project** – an initiative to stabilise Earth’s
  morphogenetic field during the Time Shift by creating a bridge zone
  frequency band, allowing humanity a safe path through upcoming
  dimensional transitions【126639197193535†L203-L218】.

## Summary

*Voyagers II* continues the Guardian narrative by focusing on the
historical and prophetic significance of the Halls of Amenti.  The early
chapters recount transmissions from the late 1990s describing how
Guardian races attempted to rescue Earth’s evolving lineages from
catastrophic distortions during the Electric Wars and subsequent seeding
experiments【126639197193535†L96-L117】.  These transmissions detail the
origins of the Arc of the Covenant, the destruction of Lemuria and
Atlantis, the quarantine of Earth and the role of individuals such as
Pharaoh Akhenaton in upholding the Amenti mission【126639197193535†L134-L169】.
Subsequent chapters unpack the mechanics of ascension, emphasising
Merkaba fields, DNA activation and the timing of ascension cycles【126639197193535†L171-L183】.
The volume also integrates a series of “current events” and “update”
sections: these provide commentary on late‑20th‑century experiments like
the Philadelphia Experiment and Montauk Project, describe emergent
projects such as the Bridge Zone and summarise agreements and conflicts
between Guardian factions and groups like the Anunnaki【126639197193535†L184-L320】.  A
final section on *Angelic Human heritage & Rainbow Roundtables* traces
the genetic ascendancy of angelic human lineages and the creation of
various Grail lines.  Overall, *Voyagers II* deepens the cosmological
framework introduced in the first volume and outlines a multi‑layered
timeline leading toward a planetary time‑shift and ascension.
